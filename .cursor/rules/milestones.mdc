# Development Milestones

This document outlines the development milestones for the MP3 file analysis backend. We follow a walking skeleton approach: get end-to-end working first, then enhance features.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup

**Goal**: Set up the project structure and development environment.

### Tasks
- [x] Initialize NestJS project structure
- [x] Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- [x] Set up Jest for testing
- [x] Create basic project structure (src/, tests/)
- [x] Add .gitignore and basic documentation

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ `npm test` runs (even if no tests exist yet)
- ✅ `npm run lint` passes
- ✅ Project structure follows NestJS conventions

---

## Milestone 2: Walking Skeleton - Basic Endpoint

**Goal**: Get a minimal working endpoint that accepts a file and returns a response.

### Tasks
- [x] Create NestJS application with basic module structure
- [x] Implement `POST /file-upload` endpoint (controller)
- [x] Accept file upload (multipart/form-data)
- [x] Return hardcoded JSON response: `{ "frameCount": 42 }`
- [x] Add basic error handling for missing file

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ NestJS app starts on port 3000
- ✅ `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/file-upload -F "file=@any-file.txt"` returns `{"frameCount": 42}`
- ✅ Missing file returns 400 error
- ✅ Endpoint accepts multipart/form-data
- ✅ Response is valid JSON with correct Content-Type header

---

## Milestone 3: MP3 Frame Counting - Basic Implementation

**Goal**: Implement actual MP3 frame counting (no streaming yet, load entire file).

### Tasks
- [x] Create MP3 parser service
- [x] Implement frame sync pattern detection (0xFF 0xFB or 0xFF 0xFA)
- [x] Parse frame headers to extract frame length
- [x] Count frames by iterating through file
- [x] Return actual frame count

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ `POST /file-upload` with valid MP3 file returns correct frame count
- ✅ Frame count matches expected value for test MP3 files
- ✅ Invalid MP3 files return 400 error with appropriate message
- ✅ Unit tests for MP3 parser with sample files

**Test Files Needed**:
- Small valid MP3 file (< 1MB)
- Medium valid MP3 file (5-10MB)
- Invalid file (non-MP3)

---

## Milestone 4: Error Handling & Validation

**Goal**: Add comprehensive error handling and input validation.

## Development Workflow

### For Each Milestone

1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b milestone-X-description`
2. **Write failing tests first** (TDD approach)
3. **Implement feature** to make tests pass
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
5. **Verify acceptance criteria** are met
6. **Create PR** with description of changes
7. **Code review** and address feedback
8. **Merge** to main branch

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual services/modules in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with test fixtures
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete flow (optional, can be manual for MVP)

### Definition of Done

Each milestone is considered complete when:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria are met
- ✅ All tests pass (unit + integration)
- ✅ Code is reviewed and approved
- ✅ Documentation is updated
- ✅ Changes are merged to main branch

## Notes

- **Walking Skeleton First**: Milestones 1-3 focus on getting something working end-to-end
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Each milestone builds on the previous one
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation where possible
- **Local First**: Develop and test locally before deploying to AWS
- **Fail Fast**: If a milestone is blocked, identify and resolve blockers before proceeding
